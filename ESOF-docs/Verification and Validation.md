#Assignment 4: Verification and Validation

##Software Testability and Reviews

###Controllability
*   Ability to easily control the inputs to produce a specific output

Leaflet's tests are generally flexible and easily malleable, although for specific modules modifying them is more difficult.

The following snippet, which tests the function ```L.Util.splitWords()```, is an example of an easily controllable test. In this particular scenario, the function splits the string *'foo bar baz'* into the array *['foo', 'bar', 'baz']*. If the desired array was *['esof', 'docs']*, the input would be the string *'esof docs'*.
```javascript
describe('#splitWords', function () {
	it('splits words into an array', function () {
		expect(L.Util.splitWords('foo bar baz')).to.eql(['foo', 'bar', 'baz']);
	});
});
 ```

On the other hand, there are some tests that are state-dependent and thus don't have high controllability. Since JavaScript has multiple implementations depending on the browser, some functionalities have to be tested for each of the specific browsers (this will be talked about in detail in the Heterogeneity section).

###Observability
*   Ability to easily observe the test results

By running tests in ```spec/index.html```, the page will indicate specifically which tests failed and which ones passed, showing the expected and the obtained results, although it won't indicate test coverage.

To get a detailed overview of the test coverage, Jake will provide the overall details from each folder, including statements, branches, functions and lines, in the file ```coverage/<environment>/index.html```.

###Isolateability
*   Ability to test specific components in isolation

Leaflet is organized into modules and the isolateability depends on the complexity of the module. For the simpler ones, the tests have high isolateability, while the higher level ones have multiple dependencies that makes it harder to isolate them.

The Leaflet tests adopt the following pattern:
*   create a few objects necessary for the tests;
*   run tests using those objects;

This means that there will be one or more tests that makes use of one or more object, reducing the degree to which each test is isolated.

###Separation of Concerns
As observed in the ```spec/suites/``` folder, there is a corresponding test file for each source file. Each test is responsible for a single functionality.

###Understandability
Using the ```spec/index.html```, there is a brief description to the test being done. Another testing method wouldn't display a description of the tests.

###Heterogeneity
*   Heterogeneity is when different technologies require different test cases.

As mentioned in the Controllability section, Leaflet can run on different browsers and each of them has a different JavaScript implementation, requiring browser-specific tests. In order to execute the tests in a specific browser, a flag should be added to the command, for example: ```jake test --chrome```. This way, the test will be executed on Chrome and the results are going to be displayed on the console. If no browser is selected, the test environment will run in the PhantomJS engine.

In Leaflet the tests are heterogeneous since the tests don't always follows the same type of test, changing the way the code is tested.

##Test Statistics and analytics
For Leaflet, running test cases is very simple. It is described in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file and the tester only needs to install PhantomJS and a Node.js package called Jake.

To run the tests, run the command:
```
jake test
```

In order to get the coverage, run:
```
jake test -cov
```

Another option is simply to open ```spec/index.html``` that makes use of mocha nodeJS manager and the tests will run automatically.

As mentioned before, Leaflet uses Jake. With this build tool, tests can be easily executed as well as test coverage.
There are around 540 tests executed on Leaflet's test suite. This tests cover several components. However, this isn't enough to assure that Leaflet is working well. In order to check this, it is necessary to check test coverage.
The test coverage results are shown below:
![Test Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiogoMCampos/Leaflet/ESOF-Documentation/ESOF-docs/resources/TestCoverage.png)
As seen in the results, Leaflet tests have a good coverage with an average of 70%. However, some components could have a better coverage, for example the Handler which has a lower coverage.


##Bug identification and correction
In order to contribute to the repository we started by trying to find a bug that wasn't described in the issues. However, after a long time without any results, we opted by selecting a bug from the issues list.
We took a look into issue [5116](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/5116) and tried to figure out what was wrong.
With the recommendations given we tried to correct and reached a similar solution that another user had already reached. However, that tester said his solution didn't work, so we tried to figure out what was wrong and we think we came to a conclusion: there were errors on the test scene provided, making it impossible to work.
So we fixed the test scene and it worked out. We left a comment with our solution,

We were determined to fix a bug, and so we looked for another issue. We ran into issue [5107](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/5107).
We tested on the platforms the user cited (Chrome Beta and Android 7.0) and our output didn't match the user's.
We got the desired output (same as other browsers and platforms) so we commented the issue.

However, we didn't consider those to be *fixed* so we tried a different issue: [5149](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/5149).
It was tested and by adding the option ``` noWrap: true``` to the example the test would provide the expected result without modifying anything in the library. While trying to solve the error, we discovered that forcing a range the same way as the developers wasn't correct since they didn't confirm if the two point relatives to the area selected (nw and se) were in the same range. This is exemplified in our comment in the issue link, so the best way to understand our thinking process is to read that comment.

We ended up correcting the bug mentioned in our comment and submitted a pull request: [5164](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/pull/5164).
