##Introduction

Leaflet follows the model view controller architecture. It separates the handling of mouse interaction from geometry that is shown on the map and others.
One architectural pattern this project follows is **Repository architecture**. This allows changes to be propagated easily between all components.
Another pattern is **Client Server architecture**. The program sends a request to popular websites to get map data.
