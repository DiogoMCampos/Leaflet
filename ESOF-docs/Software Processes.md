#Assignment 1: Software Processes

##Project description
Leaflet is an open-source library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It is designed to be very lightweight, in order to have a great performance across multiple platforms and highly extensible, keeping a small core and allowing user-created plugins.

Although Leaflet uses some recent technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3, it is also accessible on older browsers, due to continued efforts on maintaining compatibility.

The first commit to GitHub was on September 1st, 2010 and the version 1.0.0 was released on September 26, 2016. Over the past 6 years, Leaflet has had 100 different contributors (28 in 2016 alone), with Vladimir ([mourner](https://github.com/mourner)), Ivan ([IvanSanchez](https://github.com/IvanSanchez)), Yohan ([yohanboniface](https://github.com/yohanboniface)) and Per ([perliedman](https://github.com/perliedman)) being the core ones.

The software is published under the [2-clause BSD License](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE).

##Software development Process
According to the core members of this project, they use a branch separate from the master branch to work on additional features and/or fix bugs. More specifically, they use a single branch per feature or bug.

For each Pull Request provided, it is preferable to include some testing, if possible for validation purposes. It is also important that someone else reviews that request before merging with the master branch.

Because the time spent by the contributors on the project is small, they don't use software development processes like Agile or XP. Leaflet has no release dates. The issues published are usually filtered because sometimes the reported issue isn't a bug but a user problem.
