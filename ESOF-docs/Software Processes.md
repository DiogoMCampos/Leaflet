#Assignment 1: Software Processes

##Project description
Leaflet is an open-source library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It is designed to be very lightweight, in order to have a great performance across multiple platforms and highly extensible, keeping a small core and allowing user-created plugins.

Although Leaflet uses some recent technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3, it is also accessible on older browsers, due to continued efforts on maintaining compatibility.
