#Assignment 2: Requirements Elicitation

##Requirements
Leaflet new features can be chosen in two ways: either the main core team can decide which features to implement or the community.

The team usually works on fixing the existing bugs or implementing some new features (as we have previously mentioned, right now the team is working on map rotation).

However, if an user has an idea of a new feature he can suggest it on [this page](https://leaflet.uservoice.com/forums/150880-ideas-and-suggestions-for-leaflet). Users can also up-vote the listed features and the team will discuss the implementation of this feature. If the team decides the suggestion is good, they mark it as "planned" and will implement it later.
